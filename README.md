## Contribute

To contribute to the docs, fork the composer/composer repository and add or
change a file in the doc directory. Documentation sources can be browsed
at https://github.com/composer/composer/tree/main/doc

Documentation is then automatically generated on getcomposer.org

## JS / CSS

To change JS and CSS, make sure you run `npm install` first and then use
`npm run dev` or `npm run build` to build new assets from the sources.

The output of build should be committed to be deployed, but please do not commit
it if you are sending a pull request.
